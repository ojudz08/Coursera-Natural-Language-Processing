# Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

This is part 1 of the NLP course specialization offered in Coursera. 

This course focuses on the following:

a. Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then Naïve Bayes.

b. Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and

c. Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
