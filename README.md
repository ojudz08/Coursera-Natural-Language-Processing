# Natural Language Processing Specialization

This is a course specialization offered in Coursera. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms allowing computers to interpret human speech or text. 

This specialization focuses on the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques such as:

* Logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes and Word Vectors
  * To implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.

* Dynamic Programming, Hidden Markov Models and word embeddings
  * To autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

* Dense and Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, GRUs and Siamese Networks
  * Used TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions. 

* Encoder-decoder, Causal and Self-attention
  * To perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering, and to build chatbots.
